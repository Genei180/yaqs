# YAQS – Yet Another Quickshell Setup

**YAQS** is my personal configuration for [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org/), a flexible Wayland shell replacement.
I try to focuses on simplicity, modularity, and a clean user experience — without pretending to be the “final word” in shell configs (because it isn’t).

An Additonally Goal of mine is to make it Mobile Friendly so i can use it with mobile Nix.
(Or Atleast make some Parts Reusable)

## 📦 Requirements

Placeholder Text:
* [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org/) (latest build recommended)
* A Wayland compositor with layer-shell support (tested on Hyprland)

Clone into your Quickshell config directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Genei180/yaqs.git ~/.config/quickshell
